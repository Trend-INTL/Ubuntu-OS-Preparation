I want to know why you make odoo-data volume as following:  odoo-data:/var/lib/odoo 
how do you know that this path has all odoo files, 
Also how can I know which path ubuntu use to install & store odoo files like: filestore & sessions?

In Docker setups for Odoo, the `odoo-data` volume is commonly mapped to `/var/lib/odoo` because this path is the default directory where Odoo stores its files, including filestore, sessions, and other relevant data.

Here’s a breakdown of why `/var/lib/odoo` is used and how you can find out where Odoo stores its files on Ubuntu:

### Why `/var/lib/odoo`?

1. **Default Configuration**: Odoo's default configuration for storing data like filestore and session data is usually set to `/var/lib/odoo`. This path is specified in the Odoo configuration file (`odoo.conf`). 

2. **Volume Mapping**: In Docker, when you map a volume like `odoo-data:/var/lib/odoo`, you are ensuring that all the data within this directory is persisted across container restarts and re-creations. This directory typically includes:
   - **Filestore**: Stores file attachments and binary data related to records.
   - **Sessions**: Stores session data if configured.
   - **Configuration**: Sometimes also includes configuration files and other operational data.

### Determining the Paths on Ubuntu

To find out where Odoo is installed and where it stores its data on Ubuntu, you can follow these steps:

1. **Check the Odoo Configuration File**:
   - The default configuration file for Odoo is usually located at `/etc/odoo/odoo.conf` or `/etc/odoo.conf`.
   - Open this file to check the configuration settings. Look for parameters like `data_dir` and `addons_path`.

     ```bash
     sudo cat /etc/odoo/odoo.conf
     ```

     In this file, you might see something like:

     ```
     [options]
     data_dir = /var/lib/odoo
     addons_path = /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/odoo/addons
     ```

     Here, `data_dir` specifies the directory for filestore and session data.

2. **Check the Installation Directory**:
   - Odoo’s core files (source code) are typically located in directories like `/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/odoo/` or `/opt/odoo/` (if you installed it from a package or a zip file).

     ```bash
     dpkg -L odoo
     ```

     This command lists all files installed by the `odoo` package and shows where the application is installed.

3. **Default Paths**:
   - **Filestore and Sessions**: Usually `/var/lib/odoo`.
   - **Addons and Modules**: Typically located in `/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/odoo/addons` or `/opt/odoo/addons`.

4. **Check Running Configuration**:
   - If Odoo is running, you can check the configuration options used by inspecting the process or logs.

     ```bash
     ps aux | grep odoo
     ```

     This might give you information about the command line options used to start Odoo, including paths.

### Summary

The path `/var/lib/odoo` is used in Docker setups based on the default Odoo configuration. To confirm paths on Ubuntu, check the Odoo configuration file (`odoo.conf`), and use commands like `dpkg -L odoo` to determine the installation paths.
